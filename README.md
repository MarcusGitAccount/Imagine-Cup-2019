# Imagine-Cup-2019
Developing Upper as an entry application for Imagine Cup 2019. Upper is meant to be a tool that will aid educators in teaching children with autism.

Upper is a tool meant to tackle the issues faced by teachers working with children with autism and other related disorders. 

Our project helps educators understand their pupils with special needs by giving them a web app tool to analyse childrenâ€™s emotion and feedback to different questions during the class.
